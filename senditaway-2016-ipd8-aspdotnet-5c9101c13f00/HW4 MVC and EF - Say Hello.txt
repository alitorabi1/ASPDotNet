Steps for MVC form handling

1. Create the project MVC
2. Add a controller which will also add directory for View, without any views yet.
3. Ask yourself what data will this form operate on
and create a Model class (similar to Entity) that reflects
fields of the form you want to create.
4. Add a View with Model, with annotations
5. Build->Rebuild solution (maybe)
6. Complete your HTML form with the necessary fields

NOTE: you can use Razor syntax or do regular POST-HTML, but then you would not have the validation of Model
RECOMMENDATION: User Razor

HOMEWORK:
1. Complete the exercise - Say Hello
2. Create new project with the same UI
where on successful submission you add record to Database
using Entity Framework.
